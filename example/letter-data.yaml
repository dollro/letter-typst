# LETTER DATA — letter-typst
# ==========================================================
#
# This file supplies all personal content for the DIN 5008
# cover letter generated by the letter-typst package.
#
# The package contains zero personal data — everything comes
# from this dictionary, which is loaded via yaml() in your
# entry-point .typ file.
#
#
# ── YAML STRING STYLES ──────────────────────────────────────
#
#   >-     Prose / long strings — folds line breaks into spaces,
#          strips trailing newline. Best for paragraphs.
#   |      Preformatted — preserves line breaks as-is.
#   plain  Short values without special characters.
#   "..."  Short values with special chars (: # { } etc.)
#
#
# ── IMAGE PATHS ──────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# All image paths (signature) are resolved relative to the
# consumer project root (where your .typ entry point lives),
# NOT relative to the letter-typst package directory.
# Images must be pre-loaded via image() in the entry point and
# passed as parameters (signature-image).
#
#
# ── REQUIRED FONTS ───────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Source Sans 3 (headings/body text), Source Serif 4 (narrative).
# OTF files are bundled in example/fonts/. Fonts must be
# installed in the build environment.

      I am writing to express my strong interest in the Head of Product

      In my current role as VP Product at TechVentures, I lead a
      cross-functional team of 20 across product management, UX, and
      engineering. Under my leadership, we launched three new product
      lines that grew annual recurring revenue from EUR 2m to EUR 12m
      within two years, while maintaining industry-leading customer
      satisfaction scores.

      Previously, as Senior Product Manager at GreenPower AG, I drove
      the commercialization of an IoT-based energy management platform,
      taking it from proof of concept to 500+ enterprise customers. This
      experience, combined with my technical background in computer
      science, enables me to bridge the gap between technology and
      business strategy effectively.
